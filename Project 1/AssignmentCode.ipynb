    "\n",
    "The **exploratory data analysis** is the statistical treatment to which the samples collected during a research process in any scientific field are subjected.\n",

    "### Application to Data Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "In **data mining**, although not mandatory, it is a good practice to analyze the data you will be working with in order to observe its main characteristics in order to get an idea of the structure of the data set, and identify the target variable and possible modeling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Process**\n",
    "- *Transform the data*: It helps us know what to do with null, missing values, or atypical data. In addition, it establishes if there is a need to reduce the dimensionality of data.\n",
    "- *Visualize*: Use some tool to make a graphical representation of the data, for example, R, Jupyter notebook, Google Colab, etc.\n",
    "- *Analyze and interpret*: Analyze and interpret the data through different visualizations.\n",
    "- *Document*: Document all the graphs and statistics generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is also helpful when reviewing the data description to understand the meaning of each characteristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several activities in doing an exploratory data analysis but in terms of data mining the key points to be made are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description of the data structure.\n",
    "- Identification of missing data.\n",
    "- Detection of outliers.\n",
    "- Identification of relationships between variable pairs."
